# work in progress
The script for the R6 object version of the "circle" data is not being worked on at the moment, as I amnot too sure if that really helps at all.
I am currently working with a version that simply uses a list as the data structure for circle data.
This isn't exactly the original instructuions but I think replicating the entire julia script and then using ggplot to plot the result is the best way to go.
Perhaps in the future I can work on incorporating this visualization for any RNA seq result that can be visualized like this.
